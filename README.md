.
(You’ll get a .zip file containing simpleScreenGrab.exe.)

Release mouse → the screenshot is copied to clipboard.

Press Esc to cancel without capturing.

⚠️ Windows may show a SmartScreen warning since this app isn’t code-signed.
Click More info → Run anyway to continue.

I recommend building from source, this will prevent the SmartScreen warnings from occuring.

- <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Download Python</a>

Open a terminal and run:

- git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simpleScreenGrab.git
- cd simpleScreenGrab
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py

To make a standalone Windows executable:

- pip install pyinstaller

- pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py

The compiled .exe will be in the dist/ folder.
Double-click it to run without needing Python installed.  You can bind this to a key or mouse button to use as a macro.
